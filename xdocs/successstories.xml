        		<p>We started using WO5.1 on Windows, and I was all like WO RUlEZ!  Only it
				became quite apparent, that Project Builder hadn't evolved in any
				significant way since WO4, at least on Windows.  Eclipse and WOLips made
				it so easy.  I can still use WOBuilder and EOModeler, but with WOLips
				and WOProject, my employees can use WebObjects from within Eclipse.
				This makes our new WO projects first class developer citizens alongside
				our J2EE older (maintainence) projects.

				In short, WOLips staved off developer revolt, and allowed me to pursue a
				WebObjects strategy unimpeded by Apple's lagging IDE.</p>
