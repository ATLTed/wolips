        <section name="Welcome to WOProject">
        <p>Welcome to WOProject project page. WOProject provides a set of tools to work 
        with WebObjects 5.1 independent from platform and IDE. Even though Apple is doing a
        great job maintaining cross-platform development tools, for obvious reasons support 
        for such tools on platforms other than Mac has been declining over the years. At the
        same time in Java world new technologies have emerged that allow to organize 
        and build projects with code, resources and documentation in an IDE-independent 
        fashion. WOProject includes all necessary support to take advantage of these 
        technologies (namely 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Ant</a>). Even people using
        latest and greatest ProjectBuilder on Mac may find it useful to organize 
        their code in a portable manner. This IDE independence is partially achieved in
        current release of WOProject.</p>
        
        
         
        <p>Other aspects of WOProject are integration of WebObjects NSLog's with 
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/index.html">Log4J
        logging framework</a>, database plugins and other WebObjects utilities.</p>
