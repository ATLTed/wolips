Files:
.project: Required to get the branches within Eclipse.
buildserver.version: Maintained by the buildserver.
build.properties: Your build properties.

Folder:
homepage: The Anakia xml files to create the homepage for www.objectstyle.org/woproject
woenvironment: Abstraction layer to get nextroot and so on on different platforms
woproject: woproject
wolips: wolips
If you have the time, it would be great if you can take a look at the new project structure.

How to use it:
The parent folder of projects should be woproject.

1. At the command line cd to the projects folder.
2. Call the migrate build script: 'ant -buildfile build_migrate.xml' This will copy the stuff from the woproject folder to the right places in the projects folder.
3. Call the build script: 'ant'

A clean target is available in both scripts 'build.xml' and 'build_migrate.xml'.

At lot of things are still missing but the concept should be visible:
- Different folders for the different projects. (homepage, woenvironment, woproject, wolips and maybe the other stuff in woproject like NSLog, the Sybase Plugin and so on)
- One buildscript per project which can be called indirectly trough the build script in the projects folder.
- Buildscripts to separate 'data and code'. Take a look at the woproject build script. It sets up the classpath and some properties and calls the script 'ant-style-project.xml' to compile the classes.
