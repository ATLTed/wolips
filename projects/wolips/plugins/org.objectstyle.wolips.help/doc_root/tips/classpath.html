<h1>Defining classpaths</h1>
<h2><a href="../images/pref/proj_path.jpg"><img src="../images/pref/proj_path.jpg" height="300" align="right" border="0"></a>Project's 
  Java Build Path</h2>
<p>There are 3 kinds of items you can add to a project's Java Build Path:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Source - from this project</li>
  <li>Projects - other Eclipse projects currently being developed</li>
  <li>Libraries - compiled code</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add a project, you actually add everything that project is defined 
  to export - which may be more than just the source. A project can export anything 
  that is included in its own Java Build Path.</p>
<p>Libraries come in various forms, and there are several ways to add them. Installed 
  (Local or System) WebObjects frameworks can be added in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li> "Add Variable…", select NEXT_LOCAL_ROOT or NEXT_SYSTEM_ROOT and extend 
    it to point at a framework's jar-file. (Selecting WOLips > Add Local Framework 
    / Add System Framework from the project context menu does the same thing.) 
    This is currently the recommended way!</li>
  <li>"Add Library…", select WebObjects Classpath, press next and check/include 
    all required frameworks.</li>
  <li>If you build using the incremental builder you can do "Add Class Folder..".</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems there are many possibilities (there are more variants than we mentioned 
  here) but if you want everything to work there is actually only one way to set 
  things up:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want different projects currently being developed to be aware of 
    each other you have to add the projects to the Java Build Paths.</li>
  <li>If you want WOLips to correctly create and maintain the PB.project file, 
    and the CLSSPATH:TXT file for applications, you must add references to the 
    installed frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that for everything to work you need to have both the Eclipse project 
  and the built/installed framework on the Java Build Path. It is recommended 
  to <a href="building.html#destdir">modify the Ant</a> script (build.xml) so 
  that it installs frameworks in the correct location every time they are built, 
  and you may want to check <a href="../reference/preferences.html#plugin_wolips_build">Build 
  after JavaBuilder</a> in the WOLips workbench preferences. In future versions 
  the <a href="../tasks/build.html#incrementalbuilder">incremental builder</a> 
  will hopefully make the Java Build Path configuration more intuitive. </p>
<h2><a href="../images/launch/classpath.jpg"><img src="../images/launch/classpath.jpg" height="300" align="right" border="0"></a>Launch 
  Configuration's Classpath</h2>
<p>If you defined your projects' Java Build Paths as recommended above you can 
  leave the launch configurations' Classpaths the at the default. For launching 
  to work the classpath must contain the built frameworks. Linking to (framework) 
  projects is not enough! If you set the Java Build Path as above you have both 
  the projects and the built frameworks on the classpath - this ok. If you want 
  to remove the projects from the classpath, that's ok too.</p>
