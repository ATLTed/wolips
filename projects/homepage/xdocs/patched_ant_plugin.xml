        	<p>Due to some memory leaks in ant Eclipse may crash with an OutOfMemoryError.</p>
 			<p>As a workaround we provide a patched org.eclipse.core.ant plugin. This patch does not fix</p>
 			<p>the memory leaks in ant. The difference is the reusage of the classloader.</p>
 			<p>The changed class is included in the download.</p>
