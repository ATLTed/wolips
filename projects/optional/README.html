<P><A href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html">License information for content of this folder.</A></P><H2>Plug-in: org.eclipse.ant.core</H2>
<P>For some time there has been a memory leak in the org.eclipse.ant.core plug-in 
  supplied with Eclipse. (The actual problem is with Ant itself). Until the problem 
  is fixed you may want to replace the supplied plug-in with this patched version.</P>
<P>org.eclipse.ant.core_2.1.0 is for Eclipse 2.1.0 and org.eclipse.ant.core_2.1.1 is for Eclipse 2.1.1.</P>
<P>Thanks,<BR>The WOLips Team.</P>
