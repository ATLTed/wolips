<h1>Release Plan</h1>
<p>WOLips development is driven by bug reports and feature requests posted at 
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=50507">SourceForge</a>. Bugs 
  that are not reported won't get fixed, and features that aren't requested will 
  not materialise.</p>
<p> WOLips is a collaborative open source effort. Please consider contributing!</p>
<p>There are three kinds of relases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Bug Fix - increments z in x.y.z - with no new features.</li>
  <li>Feature - increments y in x.y.z - new features, and possibly some bugs fixed.</li>
  <li>Major - increments x in x.y.z - with major additions and/or modifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tracker items (bug reports and feature requests) have a Status, a Category 
  and a Group. The Group indicates which release will address the item, and the 
  Category which part of WOProject.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open: Just submitted and/or not yet completed.</li>
  <li>Closed: </li>
  <li>Deleted:</li>
  <li>Pending: Waiting for reply from the original author </li>
</ul>
<p>Category: </p>
<p>Used do describe wich part of WOProject the Tracker iten concerns</p>
<p>Group:</p>
<p>The version number digits, x.y.z, have meaning:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incrementing 'z' is done for bug fix releases. These have no new features.</li>
  <li>Incrementing 'y' is done for feature releases. These have new features, 
    and possibly some bugs fixed.</li>
  <li>Incrementing 'x' is done for feature releases </li>
</ul>
