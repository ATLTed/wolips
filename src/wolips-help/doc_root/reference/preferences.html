    <td>There are two ways to build applications and frameworks: with the eclipse 
      AntRunner and as an external tool. With this option checked the external

    <td>NSProjectSearchPath</td>
    <td>The launching configuration wizard generates the NSProjectSearchPath for 
      you to enable the rapid turnaround mode for frameworks. There are two ways 
      to expand it: - in the preferences - in the launch configuration wizard 
      Under the WOArguments tab you will find a list of default arguments including: 
      "-NSProjectSearchPath (GeneratedByWOLips)" In the case of a launch WOLips 
      replaces "GeneratedByWOLips" with a path to all your projects in the the 
      workbench.(It does not matter if the projects are in folder workspace or 
      not.) If you expand the NSProjectPath in the preferences WOLips takes care 
      of the "," between the entires. If you expand it in the launch configuration 
      wizard, you have to add "," between your entries and the "GenereatedByWOLips". 
      How to add a launch configuration: - Select your project. - Select Run->Run...(Or 
      Run->Debug...) - Choose WOApplication. - Click add. - Search for the Main 
      class. - Click run. You can use this configuration to run and debug. In 
      case your NextRoot has changed you need to update your wobuild.properties 
      file. Select "Rebuild the wobuild.properties file on next launch" in the 
      preferences. On the next launch the wobuild.properties file gets an update.

    <td>Rebuild the wobuild.properties file on the next launch</td>
    <td>The Ant build script requires that this file exists, and is correct. It 
      is normally created for you the first time you start eclipse with WOLips 
      installed. If, for some reason, you need to recreate this file, check this 
      option and restart eclipse.</td>
