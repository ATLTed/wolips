<p>How-to use documentation: </p>
<ol>
  <li>make sure that WOLips is properly installed and the build.properties file 
    exists</li>
  <li>create Java Projects for the WebObjects Projects</li>
  <li>add a filter to the Package Explorer filtering out things called build (and 
    eg. WebComponents.*, for theCMSFramework)</li>
  <li>add a WebObjects Classpath container to the buildpath (Project Properties 
    / Build Path / Libraries / Advanced) and choose all the WebObjects Frameworks 
    you wish to use. (This step can be omitted on applications that use a common 
    framework if that framework exports the WebObjects classpath and if the application 
    doesn't need additional WO frameworks.)</li>
  <li>add all the .jar-files that are needed by the project (as "Internal Jar" 
    if they are in CVS, via add Variable if they are not). 
  <li>fix all the compilation problems (like wrong package names in classes)</li>
  <li>edit the Project Properties and check the "Is a WebObjects Project" checkbox 
    (also check "Is a Framework" for frameworks).</li>
  <li>create a launch configuration using the Run... menu</li>
  <li>change the runtime classpath and the source path to not be the default paths 
    (uncheck both checkboxes)</li>
  <li>(do this only after unchecking both checkboxes in the step above:) change 
    the Runtime Classpath by adding the build/&lt;projectname&gt;.woa/Contents/Resources/Java 
    Folder to the classpath <b>before</b> or instead of the Project itself</li>
  <li>(do the same for all WO-Frameworks in your Workspace, using the appropriate 
    Resources/Java folders).</li>
  <li>add the parameters -Duser.dir=&lt;path to the .woa directory under build&gt; 
    (or better: set this folder as the working directory for the application) 
    and -DWORootDirectory=&gt;$NEXT_ROOT&lt; (replacing &gt;$NEXT_ROOT&lt; with 
    the installation path of your WebObjects installation)</li>
  <li>turn on reloading of templates with -WODebuggingEnabled true</li>
  <li>turn on rapid-turnaround mode with -NSProjectSearchPath ("../..") </li>
  <li>optional: set the port the application listens on with (e.g.) -WOPort 6666</li>
  <li>run the application</li>
</ol>
<p> <<re incremental builder...>> <<is this based on work you did independant of woproject/wolips?>> 
  Yes <<building incrementally is an alternative to building with ant?>> Yes <<what are the pros and cons?>> 
  Pro: Speed Con: less flexible Sorry for being so short. You can check the (tiny) 
  documentation snip I checked into CVS Harald </p>

<p>Hi, the cvs version has an option to choose the builder. WOBuild in the project 
  properties. Ulrich </p>
<h2><a name="targetbuilder"></a>Using TargetBuilder</h2>
<p>When you build JavaClient or Direct2JavaClient applications you build two separate 
  targets, one client and one server. These two targets need separate classpaths. 
  Normally you can only have one classpath definition set per project - normally 
  you would need to define one client-project and another server-project. The 
  <a href="../reference/plugins_features.html#targetbuilder">TargetBuilder plug-in</a> 
  contains mechanisms to overcome this limitation - it allows you to develop both 
  the client and server parts in the same project.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to define the targets and store their settings in a file 
  not used for anything else (not normally used by Eclipse). When you build, the 
  settings from this file are applied to the Eclipse project one target at the 
  time. For example; first the server target settings are applied and the server 
  target built, then the same thing happens for the client target and what ever 
  other targets there are. Each build uses the normal Eclipse JavaBuilder. When 
  building is complete the original, or normal, project settings are restored. 
  The Eclipse project classpath set must, of course, contain all resources needed 
  to compile the project's source code. A specific target's classpath would be 
  a subset of the project's.</p>
<h3>Setting Things Up</h3>
<p>The targets and their settings are defined in a file called targets.plist. 
  You have to create and maintain this file manually. You can use <a href="../examples/targets.plist">this 
  example</a> as a template. When you edit it you should remember this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It should be kept directly under the project root.</li>
  <li>'classpath' are absolute paths</li>
  <li>'source', 'output' & 'projectclasspath' must start with '/' and are workspace 
    relative</li>
  <li>'projectclasspath' is a list of references to other projects</li>
  <li>You cannot use variables like NEXT_ROOT</li>
</ul>
<p>The WOLips context menu has two entries; Update TargetBuilder and Remove TargetBuilder. 
  (Although the menu option label is "Update TargetBuilder", a more correct label 
  would be "Remove & Add TargetBuilder".) </p>
<p>WOLips > Update TargetBuilder:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replaces JavaBuilder with TargetBuilder (changes in .project).</li>
  <li>Updates .classpath with information from targets.plist. (Makes certain all 
    and any resources defined in targets.plist are included in .classpath.) </li>
</ul>
<p>WOLips > Remove TargetBuilder</p>
<ul>
  <li>Removes TargetBuilder and restores JavaBuilder (restores .project). </li>
</ul>
